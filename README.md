### Hi, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student from the UK with experience creating web applications, games, and developer tools. I enjoy learning new technologies and building side projects that satisfy my curiosity.

### Things I'm working on

[Module Mate](github.com/Turnlings/grade-tracker)

A Ruby on Rails web app that helps students track study time, manage upcoming exams, record scores, and calculate final grades.

[Quokka Interpreter](github.com/Turnlings/quokka-interpreter)

Learning C by building a completely different language. It makes sense in my head...
